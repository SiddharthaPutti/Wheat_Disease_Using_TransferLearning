# Wheat_Disease_Using_TransferLearning

initial commit:- errors with vgg19 implementation, in vgg19 model fc are changed but no additional layers were added, just experimenting with fc layers, not exactly the transfer learning. i will also impliment Xception,  Inceptionv3 and resnet152 in future.

second commit- no errors recorded, but failed to allocate memory from CUDA: error type **CUDA error: CUBLAS_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED when calling `cublasCreate(handle)`**
